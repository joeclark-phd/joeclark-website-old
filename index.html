<h3>Hello world!</h3>
<p>Professionally, I am an academic researcher as well as an experienced software developer with a specialty in databases and data analytics.  I teach courses in management information systems at the University of Maine and share my expertise as a consultant to Maine businesses.  I've published an e-book on <em>data engineering</em> and have presented research papers at major international conferences, in addition to a bit of blogging.</p>
<p>Personally, I am a native Mainer who has recently returned home after two decades in exile, and I enjoy getting back in touch with the great outdoors whether it means hiking, boating, hunting, fishing, or other north woods activities.  I'm a father of four.</p>
