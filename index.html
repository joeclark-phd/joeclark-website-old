      <p class="mx-2 my-4">Greetings! I'm a Lecturer in information systems at the University of Maine and at various times a writer, researcher, software developer, and consultant. I've been a computer nerd since before it was cool, was one of the first generation of web developers in the 1990s, and I still learn something new every day about using information systems and data analytics to serve and improve business processes.</p>

          <p>I finished my Ph.D. in Information Systems at USC in 2012 and, since then, have continued to publish some academic research.  One area I've been interested in since my dissertation is theories of decision-making under uncertainty, which I study with computer simulation models.  More recently, I've become interested in work systems like Agile software development and Lean manufacturing, and how information technology can or does improve the working life in such systems.  I've published in the most prestigious information systems conferences: ICIS (SIGDSA), AMCIS, and HICSS.</p>

        <h4 class="mx-2"><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#consulting">Consulting</a></h4>
        <div class="mx-2 collapse" id="consulting" data-parent="#accordion">
          <p>Maine businesses have a serious need for information systems, business intelligence, and data analytics talent that is not always available for hire locally. I'm proud to offer my own humble services in these areas on a freelance basis. Consulting is also a great way for me to keep my skills up-to-date. Available year-round but especially during university winter break and summer vacation.</p>
          <p>I am what they call nowadays a "full-stack" developer, combining front-end web design skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Angular) with back-end database modeling and development (SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), and the programming layer in the middle (my main language recently has been Python, but I'm flexible).  Because I also have a pretty good understanding of statistics and data visualization (and I teach courses on these), I think my skills are uniquely suited for developing analytics and information systems that allow users to make sense of their data.  Have you got organizational databases full of potentially valuable information that you can't easily extract as reports or dashboards?  I think every business does.</p>
